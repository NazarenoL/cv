  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I can talk with the same passion about skydiving than about how to analyze
    and decompose a complex problem into a simple architecture. I started coding
    when I was 11 years old, and gave my first conference talk on secure web
    applications development when I was 17.

    I'm a strong advocate for code quality and better engineering practices, but
    capable of undertanding and influencing the business priorities, balancing
    the diverse trade-offs at different stages of a project.

    I'm learning how to broaden my impact in the company by creating a strong
    team culture, improving the workflows and processes and finding ways to
    share my experience.
